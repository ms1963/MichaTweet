Small App for accessing Twitter


This app is just a Web page enabled for mobile apps using jQuery Mobile.
The Javascript part is used to access Twitter in order to find tweets that contain a particular keyword.
The mobile app presents a list of tweets it found. When the user clicks on an entry the app presents the detailed tweet.
The sample HTML page integrates the JS code.

To achieve the mentioned dynamic behavior, an approach is required that creates the list including all links dynamically.
